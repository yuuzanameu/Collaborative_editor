positioning bugs: 
   1. positioning something as relative without analysing how that positioning affects other elements in the 
      same stacking context or different contexts leads to unpredictable and extremly hard to predict bugs. 
   Examples:

      (i) Due to having an unnecesarry relative positioning for some parent element, an overlay that belonged to a 
      different stacking context didnt render properly: it was stacked beneath the relative positioned parent element.

      (ii) Again, due to relative positioning of an element that was supposed to be covered by an overlay messed with the 
      inner DOM of the overlay, resulting in partially clickable input boxes and buttons in the sign up modal window
      sitting on top of the overlay. 

          This was fixed by using React Portals as I didnt want to dig through the mess to set up 
          the perfect stacking context or whatever. Fuck that.
